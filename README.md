# Updates and improvements to the IMEter software #

The IMEter is a tool that can help predict the effects of Intron-Mediated Enhancement (IME) on gene expression. After training from suitable input data, the IMEter can be used to score any desired intron sequence (with highers scores indicating a higher potential for enhancement).

Two papers have been published that describe the first two versions of the IMEter:

+ **IMEter v1.0:** Rose, A, Elfersi, T, Parra G, Korf I. [Promoter-Proximal Introns in Arabidopsis thaliana are enriched in dispersed signals that elevate gene expression](http://www.plantcell.org/content/20/3/543.full). Plant Cell 2008, 20:543-551 
+ **IMEter v2.0:** Parra, G., Bradnam, K., Rose, A. and Korf, I. [Comparative and functional analysis of intron-mediated enhancement signals reveals conserved features among plants](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/13/5328.long). Nucleic Acids Research, 2011.

This GitHub repository will track development on the latest — as yet unpublished — version of the IMEter (v2.1) as well as the intitial work on the next generation of the software (IMEter v2.2). Please see the following two READMEs for more details:

+ [**IMEter v2.1**](README_IMEter_v2.1.md)
+ [**IMEter v2.2**](README_IMEter_v2.2.md)
